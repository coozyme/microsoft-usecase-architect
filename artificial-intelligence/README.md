## Overview

The **Artificial Intelligence Module** provides tools and workflows for:

- Document processing and analysis.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent question answering.
- Semantic document comparison and difference analysis.

This module is built using Microsoft Azure services, including Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure Functions.

## Features

- **Document Upload & Processing**: Upload, extract, and analyze documents.
- **Question Answering (RAG)**: Intelligent Q&A with context-aware responses.
- **Document Comparison**: Semantic comparison of documents with detailed difference analysis.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for cost-efficiency and scalability.
